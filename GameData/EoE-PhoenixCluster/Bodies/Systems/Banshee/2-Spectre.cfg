			description = The inner of Banshee's worlds, Spectre orbits very near to its parent object. Its eccentric orbit suggests some upset in the past, and the periapsis is low enough that it would be too near Wight's old orbit to have been stable, suggesting that it happened in the last several billion years. The object is also quite small, closer in size to a moon than a planet, which leads to the theory that it is the lost moon of some lost planet. What happened to the planet and why Spectre survived remains a mystery.
