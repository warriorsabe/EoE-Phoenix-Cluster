			description = Orbiting beyond the other two planets of Pyros, the gas giant of Skopis stands guard. While it has no moons, it should be clearly visible from the other planets, and has a significant influence on the system. Skopis has an unusually low mass for a gas giant with so much hydrogen; one would expect it to have a density more indicative of an ice giant like Tempest or Cerberus.
