			description = Eon is an H7V star orbiting its larger companion of Epoch. While it has the potential to keep burning for quintillions of years, it is set to merge with the then-remains of Epoch in just 2 quadrillion. Some exotic chemical signatures have been detected in its spectrum, and considering the habitable temperatures of late-H stars, they may even be indicative of stellar life forms.
