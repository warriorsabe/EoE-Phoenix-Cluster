			description = Legend has it that the wormhole through which the ICS Mercury was pulled was situated near a star with the right properties and rough location to be Guardian. Its motion indicates multiple massive unseeen sources of gravity with at least one comparable to the star itself, suggesting that it may indeed be the location of the former wormhole.
